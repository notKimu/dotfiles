# Voyager
Voyager is my KDE Plasma + Bspwm desktop.

I use plasma for everyday use because of how convenient it is, I can plug external monitors, USBs, phones, etc without much trouble or touching the terminal.

Bspwm on the other hand let's me focus and is more careful with the resources on my laptop, so I keep it for when I need it.

I'll make you a tour over the KDE config.

# The dock
The dock I am using is called [Latte Dock](https://github.com/KDE/latte-dock), I honestly don't find it that useful but just looks sooooo cute.
Oh, and I use the default theme, I tried a lot of them but they look very... unpolished...?
# Shortcuts
I am used to window managers and I started feeling kinda "unproductive" after clicking on everything instead of using shortcuts... So I did shortcuts.
+ **Open kitty**: Meta + Return
+ `rofi -show drun -theme $HOME/.config/rofi/minimal/minimal.rasi`: Meta + D
+ **Minimize all windows**: Meta + Esc
+ **Kill window**: Meta + Shift + Q
+ **Flameshot screenshot**: Meta + Launch (D)
// Yep, I am on a MacBook

And that's about everything for KDE, enjoy!
